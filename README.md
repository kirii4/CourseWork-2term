Development of a program for the distribution of places in the hostel.
To get a place in the hostel, a list of students is formed, which includes: Student's full name, group number (six digits), average score, participation in social activities, income per family member. The hostel is primarily provided to those students whose income per family member is less than two minimum wages, then to the rest in order of decreasing average score (with equal points, priority is given to those who participated in public activities). Individual task: to display a list of the priority of providing a place in the dormitory, provided that the minimum wage is entered from the keyboard. The task common to all options is to implement authorization for logging in, administrator functionality and user functionality.
